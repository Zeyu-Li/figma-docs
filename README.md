# Figma Docs ðŸ“–

This is a doc for using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) effectively

### About

Figma is a design platform that resembles that of Adobe Illustrator but is easy to share and collaborate. Figma has two main products, Figma Design file and FigJam file. The main file for UX/UI design will be with the design file while the FigJam is more for brainstorming. Currently as of writing, FigJam is in beta testing

### Create

There are new FigJam templates but we will stick with a new blank project file to explore the documents from scratch. To start off, sign in or register for a figma account on [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) landing screen by clicking on Log in or Sign up button on the top right (see below). 

**âš  NOTE: if you are already logged in you will see the overview screen so you can skip this step**

Once you are in, you will be presented with the overview screen much like the one below. Of course yours may look slightly different.

![recent](img/recent.png)

In you main overview (see above), we have options to (from top to bottom):

1. create a new design or FigJam file or import a figma file (a file with the .fig file extension)
2. select FigJam template for FigJam file (may have been removed by the time of viewing because FigJam is currently in Beta)
3. select recent project files with helpful widgets to help you find the files you want, ie a filter, sort by or list view

## FigJam

ðŸš§ **FigJam is currently in beta at the time of writing this** ðŸš§

FigJam are a more recent addition to figma.com and as stated previously, is mostly used for brainstorming ideas. There are many tools in a FigJam file that help in this process. First let's go through the UI layout

![figjam](img/figjam.png)

First thing to notice is you are open to a canvas with a tool bar at the bottom and a header strip.

### Header

First let's name our FigJam file. This is done by clicking on the Untitled text in the header (purple section below)

![jambar](img/jambar.png)

If you want to change the team or project is under, click on drafts and select a team/project or create a new team/project

![jambar__dropdown](img/jambar__dropdown.png)

If you click on the arrow in the purple section (see above), you can

* see the version history much like the one found in Google Docs
* duplicate current project file
* rename current project file (same as clicking on the project name text)
* move project to a different team (same as clicking the current project text (currently Jam Project))
* delete file

---

1. in the blue section of the header you will find a headphone icon if you've selected a team which will allow you to do a voice chat the the team assuming you have the feature enabled by having the Figma Professional tier
2. other collaborators (and yourself) that are currently viewing the file
3. share button to share a link for someone else to view or edit [see [#share](#share) for more info]
4. comments
5. reactions and timer (see [#interactivity](#interactivity))
6. zoom level

### Toolbar

![toolbar](img/toolbar.png)

The tool bar contains (from left to right):

* mouse to select or hand to pan the canvas
* pencil to draw on the canvas (has option for highlighting as well)
* shapes - âš  they act the same as stick notes
* sticky notes - basically a text box
* text box
* connector (to show flow of 1 idea to the next)
* stamps 
* other widgets, plugins, templates and more

#### Interactivity

Since FigJam is more for interacting and brainstorming, there are ways to communicate with your team members like emotes, reactions, text messages

![interactive](img/interactive.png)

In addition you can set a timer to your brainstorming

<a name=share></a>

## Sharing/Collaborating

![share](img/share.png)

## Helpful commands

* The most helpful command is <kbd>ctrl-p</kbd> to access the quick search menu. Using this you can search for any action/feature you want to preform  instead of digging through the UI
* Zoom in and out by holding control and using the mouse wheel
* Pan the canvas by holding space and dragging
